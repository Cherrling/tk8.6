  * Bumped debhelper compatibility version to 9.
  * Added multi-arch support. This includes splitting out the tk8.6-lib
    library package with libtk8.6.so and tkConfig.sh moved into a
    multi-archified location.
  * Recreated /usr/lib/tk8.6/tkConfig.sh for backward compatibility (intend
    to remove in the future).
  * Removed .0 suffix from the libtk8.6.so library in order to remove
    unnecessary diversions from the upstream practice, provided the symlink
    for backward compatibility (intend to remove in the future).

  * Don't use the alternatives mechanism for selecting /usr/bin/wish. This
    package ships only /usr/bin/wish8.6. The tcltk-defaults package provides
    the necessary symlink. This also means that tk8.6 does no longer provide
    the wish virtual package.

    tk8.6 one.
  * Moved the Tk demos to the tk8.6-doc package.
  * Fixed clean target in debian/rules.
